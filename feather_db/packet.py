"""Context packets — required context guaranteed, everything else budgeted.

`Pocket.hot()` answers "what is this agent most likely to want", fits it to a
token budget by heat, and drops the rest. For a working set that is right. For
an operating constraint it is exactly wrong: a brand rule that says *never make
medical claims* is not more relevant because it was recalled often, and it must
not fall out of the prompt because forty creative notes outranked it. It will,
today, silently.

That is the gap Singularity's memory plan names (§1.4): *required constraints
need a separate guaranteed path and actual token accounting*. A packet is that
path. Required refs go in first and are never dropped; if they cannot be
resolved or cannot fit, the packet is **degraded** and the caller must not
perform a dependent mutation. Everything else competes for what is left, and
anything dropped is listed in `omitted` with a reason — the one thing a context
assembler must never do is lose content quietly.

    builder = PacketBuilder(pkt, budget_tokens=4000)
    packet  = builder.build(required=["compliance", "brand_safety"],
                            query="which hook should I use")

    if not packet.may_mutate:
        raise RuntimeError(packet.why_blocked())      # fail closed
    prompt = packet.text

Read-only help may degrade on purpose:

    packet = builder.build(required=[...], allow_degraded=True)
    # packet.may_mutate is False, packet.omitted says what is missing

`manifest()` is a reproducible record of what went in — refs, versions, budget,
omissions — so a decision can be replayed later. It deliberately stores
references rather than content: per the plan, a packet is revalidated against
authoritative scope and version at action time, and a stale packet must not be
able to extend expired authority.
